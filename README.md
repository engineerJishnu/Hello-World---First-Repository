About Me

Howdy!....This is the first GitHub repository - I created on 16th May 2018 and am learning how to use GitHub!

To live like other living beings, I INHALE and EXHALE - i.e. I am a "Prana" - a living being.

The name given to this "Prana" in this birth is Jishnu Chakrabarti.

I wrote my first program in the year 1988 in BASIC programming language using Sinclair ZX computer and I fell in love with computers.

Apart from Programming I also have passion for Robotics, AI, listening to music from Vinyls and Sci Fi movies from Hollywood.

My favorite language is C which is being founded by Dennis M Ritchie. Recently, I have started learning (self) C++ programming language.

I keenly wish to upgrade my career from Printing Field to Software Engineering field.

I tend to think like an engineer, work like an artist as in programming coder need to be creative in write an simple optimized codes, dream like a futuristics nerd, love like a human, and sleep like a baby.

I love watching Hollywood Sci Fi movies, as it gives insight to the brilliant ideas about how the futuristics world would look like in Blade Runner(both parts), Prometheus, Interstellar, The Terminator, Alien(1979), The Matrix, Ex Machina, Arrival, Oblivion  etc.

I will pen down my personal thoughts and comments about such movies which I come across. I may create short story of my own version and hope whoever will read this will definitely enjoy in reading.

I start with the Matrix movie and here is some interesting part of it.
