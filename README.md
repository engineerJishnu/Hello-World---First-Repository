About Me

Howdy!....This is the first GitHub repository - I created on 16th May 2018 and am learning how to use GitHub!

To live like other living beings, I INHALE and EXHALE - i.e. I am a "Prana" - a living being.

The name given to this "Prana" in this birth is Jishnu Chakrabarti.

I wrote my first program in the year 1988 in BASIC programming language using Sinclair ZX computer and I fell in love with computers.

Apart from Programming I also have passion for Robotics, AI, listening to music from Vinyls and Sci Fi movies from Hollywood.

My favorite language is C which is being founded by Dennis M Ritchie. Recently, I have started learning (self) C++ programming language.

I keenly wish to upgrade my career from Printing Field to Software Engineering field.

I tend to think like an engineer, work like an artist as in programming coder need to be creative in write an simple optimized codes, dream like a futuristics nerd, love like a human, and sleep like a baby.

I love watching Hollywood Sci Fi movies, as it gives insight to the brilliant ideas about how the futuristics world would look like in Blade Runner(both parts), Prometheus, Interstellar, The Terminator, Alien(1979), The Matrix, Ex Machina, Arrival, Oblivion  etc.

I will pen down my personal thoughts and comments about such movies which I come across. I may create short story of my own version and hope whoever will read this will definitely enjoy in reading.

I start with the Matrix movie and here is some interesting part of it.

The Matrix
----------
The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis. My most favourite part is when Trinity meets Neo at night club and when Neo meets Morpheus for the first time.

A woman named "The Trinity" is cornered by police in an abandoned hotel. After overpowering them with superhuman abilities, a group of sinister superhuman grey green-suited Agents leads the police in a rooftop pursuit of the woman. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.

Computer programmer named Thomas Anderson, living a double life as the hacker "Neo", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the cryptic phrase "The Matrix". The woman, Trinity, contacts him, saying that a man named Morpheus can explain its meaning.

Trinity: [approaches Neo at a nightclub] Hello, Neo.

Neo: How do you know that name?

Trinity: I know a lot about you.

Neo: Who are you?

Trinity: My name is Trinity.

Neo: Trinity.....The Trinity? That cracked the IRS d-base?

Trinity: That was a long time ago.

Neo: Jesus!!!

Trinity: What?

Neo: I just thought, umm....you were a guy.

Trinity: Most guys do.

Neo: That was you on my computer...How did you that?

Trinity: Right now all I can tell you is that you are in danger. I bought you here to warn you.

Neo: Of what?

Trinity: They are watching you, Neo.

Neo: who is?

Trinity: Please listen..I know why you're here, Neo. I know what you've been doing … why you hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night, you sit at your computer.

Trinity: You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us, Neo.
It's the question that brought you here. You know the question, just as I did.

Neo: What is the Matrix?

Trinity: The answer is out there, Neo, and it's looking for you, and it will find you if you want it to.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------

Neo meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between a red pill that will show him the truth about the Matrix, and a blue pill that will return him to his former life.

[Trinity has brought Neo to meet Morpheus]
Morpheus: Atlast...Welcome Neo! As you no doubt have guessed...I am Morpheus.

Neo: Its an honor to meet you.

Morpheus: No...the honor is mine. Please come and sit down. I imagine that right now, you're feeling a bit like Alice. Hm? Tumbling down the rabbit hole?

Neo: You could say that.

Morpheus: I see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically, that's not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo?

Neo: No.

Morpheus: Why not?

Neo: Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

Morpheus: I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?

Neo: The Matrix.

Morpheus: Do you want to know.....what it is?

[Neo nods]

Morpheus: The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work…when you go to church…when you pay your taxes.
"It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth."

Neo: What truth?

Morpheus: [leans in closer to Neo] That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.

[pause]

Morpheus: Unfortunately, no one can be....told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.

[opens pillbox, empties contents into his palms, outstretches his hands]

This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.

You take the blue pill [opens his right hand revealing blue pill], the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

You take the red pill [opens his left hand revealing red pill], you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

[Neo, after a pause, reaches for the red pill]

Morpheus: Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.

After swallowing the red pill, his reality disintegrates and Neo awakens, naked, weak and hairless, in a liquid-filled pod, one of countless others connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar.
